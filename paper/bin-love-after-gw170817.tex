\section{Neutron star tidal deformability}\label{sec:tidal}
We begin by reviewing how one can extract internal structure information of NSs via GW measurement.
In the presence of a neighboring tidal field $\mathcal{E}_{ij}$, such as the binary NS system found in GW170817, NSs tidally deform away from sphericity and acquire a non-vanishing quadrupole moment $Q_{ij}$ that is characterized by the \textit{tidal deformability} $\lambda$~\cite{Flanagan2008}:
This process is characterized by the \textit{tidal deformability}, $\lambda$~\cite{hinderer-love,Yagi2013}:
\begin{equation}
Q_{ij} = - \lambda \mathcal{E}_{ij}.
\end{equation}
Such tidal deformability can be made dimensionless as
\begin{equation}
\Lambda \equiv \frac{\lambda}{M^5},
\end{equation}
and can be calculated via the following expression~\cite{hinderer-love,damour-nagar,Yagi2013}:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\Lambda &= \frac{16}{15} (1-2\bar{C})^2[2+2\bar{C}(y_\R-1)-y_\R]\\
& \times \{2\bar{C}[6-3y_\R+3\bar{C}(5y_\R-8)]\\ 
&+4\bar{C}^3[13-11y_\R+\bar{C}(3y_\R-2)+2\bar{C}^2(1+y_\R)]\\ 
&+3(1-2\bar{C})^2[2-y_\R+2\bar{C}(y_\R-1)]\ln{(1-2\bar{C})}\}^{-1}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
Here $\bar{C} \equiv M / R$ is the stellar compactness with $M$ and $R$ representing the NS mass and radius. $y_\R \equiv y(R)$ with $y(r) \equiv r h'(r)/h(r)$, where a prime stands for taking a derivative with respect to the radial coordinate $r$. $h$ represents the quadrupolar part of the $(t,t)$ component of the metric perturbation that satisfies the following differential equation:
\begin{align}\label{eq:deq} 
\begin{split}
& h''+ \Big\{ \frac{2}{r} + \Big\lbrack \frac{2m}{r^2}+4 \pi r (p - \epsilon ) \Big\rbrack e^{\lambda} \Big\} h'\\
&+ \Big\{4 \pi \Big\lbrack 5 \epsilon + 9p + (p+ \epsilon) \frac{d \epsilon}{dp} \Big\rbrack e^{\lambda}- \frac{6}{r^2}e^{\lambda} - \Big(\frac{d \nu}{dr} \Big)^2 \Big\}h =0
\end{split}
\end{align}
with background metric coefficients $e^{\nu} = g_{tt}$ and $e^{\lambda} = (1-2m/r)^{-1} = g_{rr}$, while $p$ and $\epsilon$ represent pressure and energy density respectively.

The above differential equation can be solved as follows.
First, one needs to prepare unperturbed background solutions by choosing a specific EoS, or $p(\epsilon)$, and solve a set of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with a chosen central density (or pressure) and appropriate boundary conditions. The stellar radius is determined from $p(R)=0$ while the mass is determined by matching the interior solution to the Schwarzschild metric.
Having such solutions at hand, one then plugs them into Eq.~\eqref{eq:deq} and solve it with the boundary condition $y(0)=2$~\cite{hinderer-love}. 

Because there are two NSs in a binary, two tidal deformabilities $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ associated with each star enter in the gravitational waveform.
However, extracting such parameters independently is challenging due to the strong correlation between them\footnote{One way to cure this problem is to use universal relations between them~\cite{Yagi:2015pkc,Yagi:2016qmr}.}. 
Thus, what one can measure is the dominant tidal parameter in the waveform, which corresponds to the weighted average tidal deformability given by~\cite{Flanagan2008}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\Lambda} = \frac{16}{13} \frac{(1+12q) \Lambda_1+(12+q)q^4\Lambda_2}{(1+q)^5},
\end{equation}
where $q \equiv m_2/m_1$ is the mass ratio between two stars.
